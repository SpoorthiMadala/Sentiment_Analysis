# Sentiment_Analysis
Analyze the sentiment of reviews, comments, or tweets using a machine learning model built with Logistic Regression.
<br/>
## Project Overview
<br/>

This app allows users to input a text (review, comment, tweet) and predicts the sentiment as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.
<br/>

The model is trained on a CSV dataset (`data/reviews.csv`) containing text reviews and their associated sentiments. Text preprocessing is done using a custom cleaning function, and features are extracted using `CountVectorizer`.
